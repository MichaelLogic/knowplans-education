<p>6.3 Modifications. Any aspect of the Portal may be changed, supplemented, deleted or updated without notice at the sole discretion of MLA.</p>

<p>6.4 Privacy Notice. The MLA Privacy Notice (located on MLA’s website) governs the use of information collected from or provided by Affiliate at or through the Portal. With respect to any individual whose personal information is provided by Affiliate to MLA, Affiliate represents to MLA that Affiliate has obtained all necessary consents for the processing of such personal information contemplated by the services MLA is using and by the MLA Privacy Notice, including the transfer of such data to the United States or other countries whose laws may not provide the same level of protection for the personal data as the laws of the country of origin of such individual.</p>

<p>6.5. License and Ownership. Any and all intellectual property rights (“Intellectual Property”) associated with the Portal and its contents (the “Content”) are the sole property of MLA, its affiliates or third parties. The Content is protected by copyright and other laws in both the United States and other countries. Elements of the Portal are also protected by trade dress, trade secret, unfair competition, and other laws and may not be copied or imitated in whole or in part. All custom graphics, icons, and other items that appear on the Portal are trademarks, service marks or trade dress (“Marks”) of MLA, its affiliates or other entities that have granted MLA the right and license to use such Marks and may not be used or interfered with in any manner without the express written consent of MLA.

intercept or expropriate any system, the Portal or Information or that infringes the Intellectual Property (defined below) rights of another.
(e) Certain areas of the Portal are restricted.

Affiliate agrees that MLA, in its sole discretion, may terminate or suspend Affiliate’s use of the Portal, the MLA Systems, Information, Services and Content at any time and for any or no reason in its sole discretion, even if access and use continues to be allowed to others. Upon such suspension or termination, Affiliate shall immediately (a) discontinue use of the Portal, and (b) destroy any copies Affiliate may have made of any portion of the Content. Accessing the Portal, the MLA Systems, Information or Services after such termination, suspension or discontinuation shall constitute an act of trespass. Affiliate agrees that MLA shall not be liable to Affiliate or any third party for any termination or suspension of Affiliate’s access to the Portal, the MLA Systems, Information and/or the Services.</p>

<p>6.9 Written Document. Affiliate may preserve these Terms of Use in written form by printing them for Affiliate’s records, and hereby waives any other requirement that these Terms of Use be evidenced by a written document.</p>

<p>7.5 THESE WARRANTIES ARE IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p>

<p>7.6 Indemnity by MLA. MLA agrees, at its own expense, to indemnify, defend and hold Affiliate harmless from and against any and all damages and costs or, at MLA’s option settle, any claim, suit, or proceeding that the then current Licensed Software or Documentation used within the scope of this Agreement directly infringes any United States patent or copyright provided that MLA is notified in writing immediately after Partner or Affiliate receives notice of such claim of infringement and MLA is provided with sole control of both the defense of any action on such claim and all negotiations for its settlement and compromise.</p>

This Section shall not be construed to limit or exclude any other claims or remedies which MLA may assert under this Agreement or by law.</p>

<p>7.8 In the event that the then current Licensed Software is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to constitute an infringement or its use is enjoined, or in the opinion of MLA, the Licensed Software is likely to become the subject of such claim, MLA may at its option (a) procure for an End User the right to continue using such Licensed Software or (b) replace such
Licensed Software with other equivalent, non-infringing software or modify the Licensed Software to make it non-infringing; or (c) terminate this Agreement and provide a credit for such Licensed Software in the amount of the License Fees actually paid prorated on a three (3) year, straight-line depreciation basis.</p>

<p>7.9 This Section 6 states MLA’s entire obligation to Affiliate and End Users regarding infringement and indemnification.</p>

<h3 id="independent-contractors">8.0 INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS</h3>

<p>MLA and Affiliate are independent contractors and shall have no authority to bind the other. Neither this Agreement nor Affiliate’s participation in any MLA program shall be deemed to create a partnership, agency, joint venture, or other similar arrangement, and the employees, agents, or representatives of one party shall not be deemed to be employees, agents, or representatives of the other party.

<p>10.2 EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS THAT THE RIGHTS OF TERMINATION HEREUNDER ARE ABSOLUTE. NEITHER PARTY SHALL INCUR ANY LIABILITY OR COMPENSATION OBLIGATION WHATSOEVER FOR ANY DAMAGE (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGE TO OR LOSS OF GOODWILL OR INVESTMENT), LOSS OR EXPENSES OF ANY KIND SUFFERED OR INCURRED BY THE OTHER (OR FOR ANY COMPENSATION TO THE OTHER) ARISING FROM OR INCIDENT TO ANY TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT WHETHER OR NOT SUCH PARTY IS AWARE OF ANY SUCH DAMAGES, LOSS OR EXPENSES.</p>

<p>10.3 Termination is not the sole remedy under this Agreement and, whether or not termination is effected, all other remedies shall remain available.</p>

<h3 id="general">11.0 GENERAL</h3>

<p>11.1 Amendment and Waiver. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any provision of this Agreement may be amended and the observance of any provision of this Agreement may be waived (either generally or in any particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively) only with the written consent of the parties.</p>

<p>11.2 Governing Law and Jurisdiction.</p>
