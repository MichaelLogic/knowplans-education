## When Do Auctions Start?

Once a Birthday Cloud funding period ends the birthday cloud will show up in the auction system at [BirthdayClouds.com](http://www.BirthdayClouds.com).  An auction on a single cloud is 30 days starting the day after your birthday.    

Official kNOw Plans licensed promoters can then submit bids for Birthday Cloud in the form of party proposals.  These proposals will usually be based on closing Birthday Cloud balance.
If a kNOw Planner likes a certain proposal, "Accept" is click on the Proposal Review Screen.

A kNOw Planner's currently accepted proposal is put on display for other bidding promoters until the end of the auction period.
