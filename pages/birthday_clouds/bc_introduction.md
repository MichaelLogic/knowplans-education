[BirthdayClouds.com](http://www.BirthdayClouds.com) is a kNOw Plans™ product that is only available to kNOw Planners.

## Not Social Media
Birthday Clouds™ are funding algorithms that leverage the resources in kNOw Plans Network with your connected social media accounts.  BirthdayClouds.com is not social media.  kNOw Plans and all of its add-ons, plug-ins and modules are engineered to enhance the human's capabilities of making last minute decisions.

## Beta Clouds
