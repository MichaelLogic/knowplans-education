## Direct Link

Whether desktop or mobile device, a Birthday Cloud will have a permanent address accessible via browser or other social media apps. 

If a kNOw Planner is named "OhSoFuzzy43", then her Birthday Cloud address will be:

```
	http://birthdayclouds.com/ohsofuzzy43
```

## Mobile App Share

kNOw Planners can choose which social media accounts, email or phone contacts to share their Birthday Cloud.  After your initial cloud is created, Share Options will be visible at the bottom of the Birthday Cloud Screen.

## Create a Cloud

To create a cloud, see [Creating a Birthday Cloud][bc_create_a_cloud].
