## 30 Day Auction Period

A single Birthday Cloudâ„¢ Auction last for 30 days.  If a bid is not accepted within the active auction time the birthday cloud can be used at your choice of Official kNOw Plans Venues.  

## 90 Day Commitment Period
kNOw Planners must use their Birthday Cloud within 90 days after the auction. If not used before 90 Day Expiration the birthday cloud is forfeited.  This Impulse Rule is in place to maintain the Birthday Cloud's thoughtful purpose of making sure everyone celebrates their life around such a special time.  

Letting a Birthday Cloud expire does not prevent kNOw Planners from having one the following year.With a birth date saved once, a Birthday Cloud will be activated every year giving the kNOw Planner the option to "Share My Cloud".
