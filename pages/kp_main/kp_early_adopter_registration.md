## Businesses Before Consumers
When launching an application like kNOw Plans, we need to take care to release to consumers only after we have given businesses time to register and educate themselves on the many benefits and protocol. Early Adopter Business Registration will ensure that individual promoters, marketing directors, and venue managers accomplish the following before kNOw Plans Beta launch:

* SignUp for a basic kNOw Planner experience
* Learn about the business application of this new impulse utility
* Purchase a promoter license at a one-time discounted rate (optional)
* Register venue(s) (optional)
* Qualify for kNOw Plans 3%er Partnership

## Time Period
Please make note EARLY ADOPTER BUSINESS REGISTRATION WILL ONLY BE A 90 DAY PROMOTIONAL PERIOD.
THIS PROGRAM WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE WHEN THE MOBILE APP IS RELEASED TO CONSUMERS.

## Early Adopter Documents
During our Early Adopter business registration phase we will make available an updated version of the following documents:
