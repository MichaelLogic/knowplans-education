## The Power of 3

At its core, kNOw Plans is a product of the Impulse Data algorithm and the constant number of entities in its interactive ecosystem: three. 

The application logic that reverberates from this type of interactive architecture creates a wonderful balance.  When automated in current society, it is calculated to create the Trifected Impulse Data Ecosystem.

## Integrity Stardards
kNOw Plans™ is committed to protecting sensitive data and maintaining a high quality of a new special type of data that our world will grow to depend on. As part this commitment, our technopaths have derived Impulse Data Integrity Standards to motivate proper practice.

* kNOw Plans™ is partnered with a banking institution that uses a powerful TransArmor™ Token Transaction Security which is rated as the most secure in the banking industry.

* Only encrypted representations of consumer credit information is stored directly into our application database.

* kNOw Plans API access is only available to partnering POS technopaths.

* POS technopaths are identified by their technopath key and verified as valid POS developers before given access to develop with Impulse Data.

* kNOw Plans Impulse Utility is not social media which helps us minimize malicious data attacks of said platforms that are caused by human habits.
