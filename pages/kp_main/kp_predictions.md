## Unique Data Synthesis

kNOw Plans has a taken calculated steps to solving a very common problem in a unique way. This unique solution will provide promoters and venue managers the ability to predict physical consumer traffic patterns unlike any software prior to kNOw Plans.

The future of traffic created by kNOw Planners surrounds two factors:

* DISCOVERING UNKNOWNS
Goliath online retailers like Amazon do a great job of providing consumers the most efficient way to simply purchase familiar products and brands. However, Amazon has not quite proven it's ability to build inspirational brands. Few consumers use Amazon to discover products that they didn't already know about.

* PROVIDING LOCAL EXPERIENCES
The most engulfing experience an online retailer can provide is product or lifestyle video media. With kNOw Plans™ and little creative thought, even the common local retailer that is known for sheer product merchandising can become an attractive pop-in point for an entertaining or educational experience.

Retailers are now blessed with a utility that was specifically made to bring out the best two qualities they have to fight the overbearance of online retail giants like Amazon; discovering unknown products/brands and engaging in experiences.

## Consumer Patterns
So now, the big advantage of 2017 will be how well you understand the pattern in the Impulse Data being created by local physical traffic.  For instance, when kNOw Plans Network reaches [critical mass][kp_definitions.html#criticalMass] in Chicagoland, a promoter will be able to predict the kNOw Planner traffic flow on the corner of 53th and S. Harper St in Hyde Park, Chicago during the hours of 7-9pm.  

No business can currently harness that type of power even with an expensive billboard on the same corner.
