## My Bar

Digital Drink Certificates are stored in "My Bar" section of kNOw Plans.  A kNOw Planner does not have to perform a particular action to receive DDCs. Upon sending DDCs, the recipient will be alerted via Push Notification, email and in-app alert. 

There is no expiration date on DDCs you have received from active or non-active kNOw Planners.
