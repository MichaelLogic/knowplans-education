## Evolving the Local Billboard
Recall the benefits of advertising on a local billboard.
Now imagine that local billboard "automagically" hopping onto the smartphones of passers-by to deliver an engaging short message that can contain a single audio,graphic,text and/or video.  These messages are time-sensitive to increase it's impulsive impact on potential customers.

The billboard and outdoor signage has definitely seen its technical enhancements over the years.  However, kNOw Plans Impulse Alerts are to be considered a quantum leap in the area of localized advertising for one reason:
		Impulse Alerts automates a marketing professional's task of utilizing interactivity, proximity and time-sensitivity to acheive an advertising objective.  


Impulse Alerts™ empower promoters to ...

* greet all kNOw Planners that walk/drive by your event with a special customized automated alert
* efficiently deliver time-sensitive specials to patrons already inside your event
* make a kNOw Planner aware of your vendor booth at a large festival
* make a kNOw Planner aware of the location of a food truck
* provide any kind of geo-specific "call-to-action" via audio and/or video

## Discover (In Discovery)
Not to be confused with Impulse Alert's two user interface mode, [Discover Mode][kp_definitions.html#discoverMode] simply places a kNOw Planner "in discovery" which allows them to receive Impulse Alerts.

## Driver & Pedestrian UI Mode
kNOw Plans has calculated for driver saftey when handling the excitement of Impulse Alerts.  The mobile app will detect the velocity of the kNOw Planner. If velocity detected is under 7 mph (average human walking speed) the Pedestrian UI displays a slideshow of received Impulse Alerts with text content, graphics and audio.  If velocity detected is above 7 mph the Driver UI shows only the Impulse Alert™ Logo and kNOw Planners automatically hear the audio in the sequence that they were received. Drive UI Mode makes it possible for a kNOw Planner to blindly swipe left or
right to listen to the Impulse Alert audio without taking eyes off the road ahead.
