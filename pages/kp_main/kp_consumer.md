## The Largest Entity in the Ecosystem
The Consumer entity is the largest in kNOw Plans [Trifected Impulse Data Ecosystem][kp_definitions.html#ecosystemIntegrity].  These are the regular kNOw Planners that engage the mobile app for the following:

* search for events to attend
* send DDCs
* purchase something with DDCs
* check [Impulse Alerts™][kp_impulse_alerts]
* check Birthday Cloud & DDC balance

## The Lifestyle

Observe, the Millennial generation has motivated an inevitable shift in the consumer behavior among all demographics that pushed businesses into finding ways to reward the last-minute decision maker probing through streams of abundant merchants. Impulse Data will teach that “know planning” is actually “planning to let an intelligent impulse algorithm help minimize time spent on making decisions on where to go and what to do?”

In 2013, MLA surveyed 150 individuals between the ages of 21 - 40 via social media. This survey found that over 50% of the people did not plan their party outing no more than a few hours before they set foot out of the house or office.
