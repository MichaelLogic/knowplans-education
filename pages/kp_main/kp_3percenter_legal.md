With respect to any individual whose personal information is provided by Affiliate to MLA, Affiliate represents to MLA that Affiliate has obtained all necessary consents for the processing of such personal information contemplated by the services MLA is using and by the MLA Privacy Notice, including the transfer of such data to the United States or other countries whose laws may not provide the same level of protection for the personal data as the laws of the country of origin of such individual.

6.5. License and Ownership. Any and all intellectual property rights ("Intellectual Property") associated with the Portal and its contents (the "Content") are the sole property of MLA, its affiliates or third parties. The Content is protected by copyright and other laws in both the United States and other countries. Elements of the Portal are also protected by trade dress, trade secret, unfair competition, and other laws and may not be copied or imitated in whole or in part. All custom graphics, icons, and other items that appear on the Portal are trademarks, service marks or trade dress ("Marks") of MLA, its affiliates or other entities that have granted MLA the right and license to use such Marks and may not be used or interfered with in any manner without the express written consent of MLA.

Upon such suspension or termination, Affiliate shall immediately (a) discontinue use of the Portal, and (b) destroy any copies Affiliate may have made of any portion of the Content. Accessing the Portal, the MLA Systems, Information or Services after such termination, suspension or discontinuation shall constitute an act of trespass.

NO ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR INCIDENTAL TO TRANSACTIONS HEREUNDER MAY BE BROUGHT AGAINST VISION MORE THAN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE. IN ANY CASE, VISION’S ENTIRE LIABILITY UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO AMOUNT RECEIVED BY VISION DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO THE DATE THE CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE. THIS SECTION 7 DOES NOT LIMIT LIABILITY FOR BODILY INJURY OF A PERSON, WHICH IS DETERMINED TO BE CAUSED BY VISION’S GROSS NEGLIGENCE.

7.2 EACH PARTY RECOGNIZES AND AGREES THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIABILITY AND REMEDY LIMITATIONS IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE MATERIAL, BARGAINED FOR BASES OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AND REFLECTED IN DETERMINING THE CONSIDERATION TO BE GIVEN BY EACH PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND IN THE DECISION BY EACH PARTY TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.

7.3 LICENSED SOFTWARE WARRANTY. MLA warrants to the original End User that for one (1) year from the Effective Date (the “Warranty Period”) the Licensed Software will perform substantially in accordance with the Documentation.

7.5 THESE WARRANTIES ARE IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

7.6 Indemnity by MLA. MLA agrees, at its own expense, to indemnify, defend and hold Affiliate harmless from and against any and all damages and costs or, at MLA’s option settle, any claim, suit, or proceeding that the then current Licensed Software or Documentation used within the scope of this Agreement directly infringes any United States patent or copyright provided that MLA is notified in writing immediately after Partner or Affiliate receives notice of such claim of infringement and MLA is provided with sole control of both the defense of any action on such claim and all negotiations for its settlement and compromise.

7.7 Indemnity by Affiliate. Affiliate shall indemnify MLA against any damage, loss, liability or expense (including attorneys fees) (“Damages”) that MLA may incur (i) with respect to and to the extent caused by any negligent act or omission by, or willful misconduct of, Affiliates employees or agents or (ii) as a result of (a) any warranty, condition, representation, indemnity or guarantee granted by Affiliate, (b) any omission or inaccuracy in Affiliates advertisements and promotional materials that relate to the Licensed Software (other than any materials provided by MLA), (c) any modification of or addition to the Licensed Software made by Partner, Affiliate or End User not approved by MLA. This Section shall not be construed to limit or exclude any other claims or remedies which MLA may assert under this Agreement or by law.

7.8 In the event that the then current Licensed Software is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to constitute an infringement or its use is enjoined, or in the opinion of MLA, the Licensed Software is likely to become the subject of such claim, MLA may at its option (a) procure for an End User the right to continue using such Licensed Software or (b) replace such
Licensed Software with other equivalent, non-infringing software or modify the Licensed Software to make it non-infringing; or (c) terminate this Agreement and provide a credit for such Licensed Software in the amount of the License Fees actually paid prorated on a three (3) year, straight-line depreciation basis.

7.9 This Section 6 states MLA’s entire obligation to Affiliate and End Users regarding infringement and indemnification.

7.10 Only an authorized officer of MLA may make modifications to this warranty, indemnity or additional warranties binding on MLA, which modifications or additional warranties must be in writing.


### 8.0 INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS

MLA and Affiliate are independent contractors and shall have no authority to bind the other. Neither this Agreement nor Affiliate’s participation in any MLA program shall be deemed to create a partnership, agency, joint venture, or other similar arrangement, and the employees, agents, or representatives of one party shall not be deemed to be employees, agents, or representatives of the other party.
