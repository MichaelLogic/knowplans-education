## Promoters Win with Impulse
Never before has a party promoter had such “carte blanche” access to undecided party
patrons and the benefits to promoting a party through kNOw Plans.

* Increases the promoter’s rate of attracting last-minute business by placing them in front of patrons who are asking the question “Where do I go tonight?”

* Allows the promoter to duplicate himself and earn money with venues that only sprouted because of the use of an impulse event utility.

* Provides promoters another way to collect pre-sale tickets or entry fee. The fee can be adjusted for different times of the night as well.

* Provides promoters another way to pre-sell bottle service and even minor mixed drinks.

* kNOw Plan™ really isn’t an expense. It is a revenue stream.
