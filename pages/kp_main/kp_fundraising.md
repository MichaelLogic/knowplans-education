## Think Outside the Box
With community development efforts powered by an [impulse utility][kp_definitions.html#impulseUtility], many options are available to meet fundraising goals.  Keep in mind that kNOw Plans has the ability to serve information to all kNOw Planners looking to act on a charitable impulse.

Let's face it. In a world where it is "survival of the fittest", many can argue that the idea of caring for others is reduced to temporary impulsive moments of empathy. Recall the contemplation of wanting to "do more" for your community when you saw a disturbing news briefing or walked past a homeless person rummaging for scraps in a recycle bin. kNOw Plans provides the perfect outlets to direct your caring impulses by making it easy for you to find community outreach events to patronize fundraisers and volunteer valuable time.


# For Early Adopters Only

kNOw Plans Staff will publish an ongoing stream of creative fundrasing ideas before the launch of the mobile app to consumers.
