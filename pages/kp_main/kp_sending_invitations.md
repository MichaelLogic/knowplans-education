## Official kNOw Planner Invitations

kNOw Plans™ will keep track of new kNOw Planners invited to the network and automate the process of Early Adopter 3%er residual commission.  

All kNOw Plans Early Adopters under our 3%er Partnership Agreement are able to secure credit for businesses and/or promoters that they invite into the kNOw Plans Network. The main required information is the email address of the managing party of the referred business. Once a referred business has accepted the invitation it is labeled a “neuron” in your affiliate group. Just like neurons in our body, the more neurons in a 3%er's group the stronger stimulation of residual rewards.

A modal window will appear to allow you to customize the invitation.  It is suggested to take time to customize a message to the invited party that will motivate an acceptance.

### 3. Check the status of invitations via the Neurons table.
