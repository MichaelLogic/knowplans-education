## DDC Banking

In order to redeem and withdraw DDCs, a kNOw Planner must have at least one registered venue and a bank account saved with your profile. Start DDC Banking in "My Account" on the web or in kNOw Plans Business Center on the mobile app.

In realtime, venue managers can view their DDC transactions and balance via "My Account".


## POS Partners
kNOw Plans will provide information on the top 200+ point-of-sale software systems that currently service venues.  Specifically, kNOw Plans "Education" module will be the reference for adding a custom payment button to a current point-of-sale software.

## Withdrawal Transfer Time
Withdrawals are at the descretion of the venue managing kNOw Planner.  Venues have the autonomy to let DDCs accumilate indefinitely or withdraw to the associated real bank account at any time.  DDCs will convert to the currency of the receiving bank's country.  Once a withdrawal is initiated, funds will be received within 48 hours.
