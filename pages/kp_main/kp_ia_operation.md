## How do IAs function?
Impulse Alerts are meant for spontaneous announcements in association to an official [Impulse Event][kp_definitions.html#impulseEvent].  Only kNOw Plans licensed promoters can submit IAs into the ecosystem. kNOw Planners "in discovery" receive all IAs within their self-managed proximity range.
