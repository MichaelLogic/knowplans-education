## Credit Card Payment
To send Digital Drink Certificates (DDCs) to another kNOw Planner you must save a credit card to your profile.  Once you send DDCs to a kNOw Planner they cannot be returned.  Even though a kNOw Planner may have DDCs in their "My Bar", when sending DDCs they do not come from "My Bar".  Each send is a new purchase from the kNOw Planner's credit source.

### 1. Go to "My Bar"
### 2. Push the "Wet Kisses" or "Buddy Beer" 
### 3. Search for the recipient via kNOw Planner Name
### 4. Select amount
### 5. Add a message and a [Drink Suggestion][kp_definitions.html#drinkSuggestion]
### 6. Push Send

DDCs are intended to be a gift currency.  The saying will go, "If you have DDCs then you have friends that care about you."
